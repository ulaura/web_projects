		<h1>My Second Webpage</h1>

		<h2>Wait, a <i>Second</i> Page?</h2>
		<p>Yes, I'm putting together a second webpage.</p>
		<p>It's not very good, but then again I'm not trying that hard.</p>
		<p>And I'm not very good at this, haha.<p>

		<h2>So What's This Page For?</h2>
		<p>This page is for...</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Testing my knowledge in Git and GitHub</li>
			<li>Seeing if I remember anything from last time</li>
			<li>Killing time at work (Seriously, this job is slow)</li>
			<li>Creating digital magic</li>
			<li>Reminding myself that I can still learn, grow, change, and<br>
			aquire new skills</li>
			<li>And finally...so I can land a better paying and more interesting job.</li>
		</ul>
